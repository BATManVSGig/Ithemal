Gadgets are just wrappers around classes which does the actual work and processes commandline arguments.
TargetGadget -> CfgGadget -> Cfg
Cfg has TUnit which holds the Code
Cfg.get_function() -> returns the TUnit

WeightedTransformGadget holds the transforms -> WeightedTransform
We can adapt the Search.search function to do the mutations

How does plain assembly get read into a TUnit?

tools/io/tunit.h - where the readers are defined
Let's see if tunit.cc has the reading functions
tunit.cc - read_text
code.cc - read_text 
operators are defined


we added couts in following files.
tunit.cc - reading functions
code.cc - in x64asm and I think in the .h file as well.


x64asm
------
does not recognize rdtsc


dr gas syntax
-------------
does not have support for operand sizes
cmp operands in different order
